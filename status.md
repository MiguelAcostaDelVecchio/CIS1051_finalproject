#### What have you done for your project so far?

Initial research about Monte Carlo simulations, and possible API's to get stock data.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

How to create a Machine Learning Algorithm to analyze stocks
I need to collect what I have researched so far and start programming. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Machine Learning models to predict stock price are a little difficult to understand. Any suggestions on Machine
Learning libraries that I can use?
