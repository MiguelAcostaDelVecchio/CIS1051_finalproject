# Stock Suggestions Using Monte Carlo and Machine Learning Simulations

## What is the purpose of the project?
The purpose of the project is to create a program that will perform Monte Carlo and Machine Learning simulations of a
given stock's historical data. Based on the results of the Monte Carlo and Machine Learning simulations, if there is 
enough upside or downside that can be exploited (this will be specified through a certain threshold), the program will 
suggest buying or shorting the given stock.
