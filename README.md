# Stock Suggestions Using Monte Carlo and Machine Learning Simulations

## What is the purpose of the project?
The purpose of the project is to create a program that will perform Monte Carlo and Machine Learning simulations of a
given stock's historical data. Based on the results of the Monte Carlo and Machine Learning simulations, if there is 
enough upside or downside that can be exploited (this will be specified through a certain threshold), the program will 
suggest buying or shorting the given stock. Otherwise, the program will suggest to not buy the stock.

## What did I enjoy about the project?
I really enjoyed being able to learn how to get all of the different finiancial data from stocks, and cryptocurrencies
and being able to develop strategies to analyze them and make a prediction of what might happen based on researched
mathematical models. This project pushed me to learn about Monte Carlo simulations in a whole other level compared
to what was taught in class and it made me understand why it is used so frequently in different types of applications
such as financial and engineering. I was also surprised by how difficult it is to create a machine learning model to 
predict the stock prices and how abstract the concept really is. I was amazed from the different networks that the 
machine learning program uses and how it all comes together to try and predict stock prices. Even though, I was
unable create a working machine learning program to predict stock prices, the amount of information I learned from 
what is a machine learning model to how it can be applied really made this process very fun and invited me to spend
a lot of my free time learning more about this technology. 

## What did I struggle with and how did I solve it?
Trying to make programs using financial data from stocks and cryptocurrencies, really made me learn about some of the 
most used data-frames/data-structures related to csv files and storing of financial data in particular. Being able to 
correctly obtain the necessary information from those data-structures use the information to analyze it was really 
difficult. Eventually, by reading a lot of documentation and doing some testing before I tried it on the actual 
program, is what made me understand how the data-structure behaved under different circumstances and feel 
comfortable with the syntax when inputting/outputting or changing values within the data-structure. On the other hand, 
trying to understand some research done of Monte Carlo simulation and machine learning was very difficult because the
code becomes really abstract and difficult to understand (specially the machine learning program). Even though, the 
task of reading documentation and testing was really time consuming, I really learned and appreciated how sophiticated
but simple (given enough time to understand them) these programs really are.
